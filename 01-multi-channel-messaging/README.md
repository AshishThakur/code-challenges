# Overview

I would like a messaging and notification delivery mechanism, allowing me granular control on how to engage users.

# Expectations

- An expressive API to build out and dispense messages 
- Support atleast Email and Facebook Message 
- Demonstrate a way to plugin new notification channels
- Demonstrate that notification channels may tailor message to an appropriate format
- Should have both synchronous and asynchronous delivery
- A CLI interface to query, filter, sort and dispense queued messages

# Assumptions

- Leverage a FB (or any other) user provider
- Leverage cloud services for message delivery if necessary
